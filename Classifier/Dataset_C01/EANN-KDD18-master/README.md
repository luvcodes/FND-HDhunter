 ## Dataset
 **We recently release a dataset (in Chinese) on fake news from Wechat. The dataset includes news titile, report content, news url and image url. Find more details via 
https://github.com/yaqingwang/WeFEND-AAAI20**
 
 

 
 The data folder contains a subset of weibo dataset for a quick start.  If you are interested in full weibo dataset, you can download it via https://drive.google.com/file/d/14VQ7EWPiFeGzxp3XC2DeEHi-BEisDINn/view?usp=sharing. (Approximately 1.3GB)
 

 
 ## Main Idea
One of the unique challenges for fake news detection on social media is how to identify fake news on  **newly emerged events**. The EANN is desgined to  __extract shared features among all events__ to effectively improve the performance of fake news detection on never-seen events.


## Experiment
Comparision between reduced model (w/o adversarial) and EANN(w adversarial)

The feature representations learned by the proposed model EANN (right) are more discriminable than fake news detection (w/o adv).
